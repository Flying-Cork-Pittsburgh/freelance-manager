WordPress plugin for freelancers who manage client sites

This plugin runs on the website of the web professional, and used to manage
information about client sites. It uses a Client custom post type, and adds a
meta box to enable some custom fields.



I'd love to know your thoughts/needs regarding managing client websites.
