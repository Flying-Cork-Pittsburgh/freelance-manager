Freelance Manager
=================

WordPress plugin for freelancers who manage client sites

This plugin runs on the website of the web professional, and used to manage
information about your client websites. It uses a Client custom post type, and adds a
meta box to enable some custom fields.

## Current Features
* Client CPT
* Message CPT

## In Progress
* Ability send new message, update messages, delete messages to the [freelance-client](https://www.github.com/andrewwoods/freelance-client) dashboard.
* WP-CLI commands to add, update, remove, and list Clients

I'd love to know your thoughts/needs regarding managing client websites.
